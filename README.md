# ticker-react

**ticker-react** is an example React client which pulls stock quotes from the (defunct but still available) Google Finance API by using the [ticker-phoenix](https://github.com/philcallister/ticker-phoenix) Elixir Phoenix app. This React client app subsribes to Phoenix Channels with stock ticker symbols and is periodically notified of updates.

To see the **ticker-react** app in action, head over to
- [ticker-elixir](https://github.com/philcallister/ticker-elixir) Elixir OTP app
- [ticker-phoenix] (https://github.com/philcallister/ticker-phoenix) Elixir Phoenix app
